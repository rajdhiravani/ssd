              My first association with riidl was during Maker Mela 2016 which
              is Asia's biggest Maker movement organised by riidl. I got an
              opportunity to develop my design skills as a Creative Head when I
              worked directly with the Core Team. riidl has a very friendly work
              environment which is critical for peer to peer learning. Everybody
              is ready to help others. They have a host of high quality
              prototyping facilities, mentoring network and events to
              participate and learn from.
            </p>
            <p>
              While preparing my portfolio for NID, my experience at riidl
              really helped me get an edge in my presentation.I created
              prototypes for my 3D designs through laser cutters and 3D printers
              which produced a superior quality output.I received excellent
              critical remarks on my portfolio from everyone at riidl, that is
              very important for a design to be successful.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the help of riidl, I was able to secure AIR 3 in the NID
              Entrance exam (my first attempt) and got admission in M.Des
              Product Design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I am very happy that riidl is starting its own Design school
              and I am sure students would benefit from all the prototyping
              facilities, great industry connections and a friendly environment
              that riidl offers! The best part is that a startup incubator like
              riidl who is deeply involved in making relevant products
              empowering the startup community is offering this course on
              product design. It can't get better.

              riidl is a place for experimentation where all ideas are welcomed
              and students are given a chance to explore and find their niche.
              It gave me a platform to explore different aspects of design and
              helped the engineer inside me to transform into a designer as that
              was my interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              I recollect I started my graphic design internship at riidl where
              a student like me had a chance to interact with real clients and
              work with startups. That's when I could design infographics and
              marketing collaterals and my journey into understanding user
              requirements and building a solution started.
            </p>
            <p>
              Back then, when I was working on my startup idea, I spent a lot of
              time at riidl's FABLAB learning and using 3D printing and laser
              cutting. It was a playground for design enthusiasts like me. I
              learnt a lot from the experts about engg vs design approach. I
              could also go for a 3 days forge pitch camp in Coimbatore through
              riidl When riidl was building its new office space, they gave me
              an opportunity to design it for them where I got a chance to make
              a formal pitch collating my ideas and concepts for the interiors.
              I also enjoyed designing and painting illustrations/murals on the
              office interior & furniture.
            </p>

              I feel very fortunate to have got these opportunities from riidl
              to dabble into diverse aspects of design and It has helped me
              secure admission into Delft university where I'm learning about
              product design. I feel privileged to share my learnings with riidl
              academy to shape their BDes program to incorporate best practices
              used globally in Design education.

              riidl has been home for me, there's no two ways to it. Through the
              last 4 years of my life, I have been associated with almost every
              initiative this beautiful academy of excellence has to offer.
              Moreover, for me personally, riidl has been a ladder of growth.
              From being a crew member at Maker Mela in 2018 to the Managing
              Director of the entire 200+ team in 2020, it's been a
              rollercoaster learning process. It is because of this institution,
              because of which I was able to live through the greatest
              highlights of my journey. Representing a startup called U-Farm, at
              IIT Madras, at the prestigious Gopal Deshpande Center of
              Innovation, as an Entrepreneur, and being selected as the Outreach
              and Operations Lead of Facebook Developer Circles Mumbai. All the
              opportunities I've got here, I have just grabbed them with both
              hands. Till date, I've recieved several national and international
              awards. I was conferred with the "Global Top 50 Tech Visionaries
              Award" in 2019 and was invited to Dubai for a 3 day international
              conference. Without a second thought, I've gifted The Award Plaque
              to Shri Gaurang Shetty, and it is placed exactly where it needs to
              be, at riidl, because it's because of him, and riidl, that I had
              the honor to represent my country on an international level, not
              only once, but twice. Our project at Bioriidl, was chosen at iGEM,
              which is the world's largest project competition, and we were
              invited to Boston, to represent India at the iGEM Giant Jamboree
              Conference. That very year, I enrolled myself into a 6 month
              Diploma, which riidl has to offer, called Startup School India,
              curated by someone I feel is as close as family, Mrs. Hetal
              Mundra, and that is when through the Design Thinking workshop by
              Mr. Amit Kundal, I was introduced to the world of design, and
              guess what? At present time, I have completely switched my career
              from Engineering to Design. It was because of this course, that I
              was able to launch my own startup, an Influencer Marketing firm,
              197 Entertainment. "Top 100 Marketing and Advertising Leaders
              2020", "Startup CEO of the Year 2020", and now, "40 Under 40
              Indian Achievers 2020". All of these recognitions are not for me,
              they are for this hub of opportunities, that I proudly call home.
              Research, Innovation, Incubation, and Design Laboratories.

              My introduction to riidl happened as I became a student here at
              Startup school India (6 months diploma in Entrepreneurship). This
              isn't just another course. It is not theoretical and nothing that
              we learnt in these 6 months was redundant. We had so many
              activities plus a startup that we started building alongside, so
              everything that we learnt was immediately put to use. Challenging
              activities where we were always given full freedom to be as
              creative and wildly imaginative as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Access to equipment/ machinery was available when we wanted to
              bring our product ideas to reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sequence of our entire curriculum - from design thinking to IT
              skills, was designed in such a way that every aspect of business
              was well taught and covered in perfect chronology. We didn't just
              gain insights from the industry leaders but were also supported by
              an entire team of super generous and genius individuals who were
              always there for us throughout the course. These six months also
              gave me the opportunity to network with some great minds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Riidl team designs courses with so much thought and keeping
              students and contemporary trends at the center. Somaiya School of Design is
              going to be one of those revolutionary education institutes which
              we all dream of.

              Startup school India gave me an edge to my engineering career.
              Everyone graduates by passing exams but Startup School India has
              helped me polish my Critical thinking skills and my ability to
              express ideas meticulously. All the Gurus of Startup school India
              were masters in their own field and that's what I like about the
              programs at riidl. They bring the best people in the industry for
              us to learn from. Out of which, Design thinking and Graphic
              designing happens to be my favourite modules as we had to put our
              ideas into practice which boosted my creativity and confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are no exams, only fun assignments ( I should not be calling
              it assignments also) and final assessment is nothing but your
              growth and prototype of your idea. As they say, even fool can come
              up with best ideas but only genius can execute it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best part of entire Diploma was, Sanchalak made sure we keep
              track of our journey and maintained it on Gitbook. It is
              fascinating how one can grow when you let your ideas fly wild and
              riidl facilitates that.

              Myself Apeksha Patel, graduate student of KJSSC in Department of
              Microbiology and Biochemistry. During my UG period I had been a
              team member of MakerMela and helped in organizing the 2018
              MakerMela event, organized by riidl.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019 I had joined a conversant multidisciplinary team, iGEM
              team Bioriidl Somaiya, working on a project for the iGEM
              competition, an annual International competition on synthetic
              biology, organized by MIT. The team was organized and guided by
              Bioriidl, and funded by Somaiya trust. With which I got the
              opportunity to work side-by-side with Ms. Bhavna Pandya (PI of the
              team), Head of Bioriidl. We had constructed a project on
              sterilization of culture media 'Steriport'. We worked for more
              than 8 months on this project and in November we showcased our
              project at the iGEM Giant Jamboree, Hynes Convention center,
              Boston, USA.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last year, I participated in Maker Mela 2020 as a maker and
              exhibited my project 'Green Charge'. In addition, before
              covid-crisis initiated learning web development and data science
              with Facebook developers circle, Mumbai, which is an extended
              learning organization of riidl . It's great fun learning with
              them, adding a feather to my cap.
            </p>
            <p>
              riidl and Bioriidl had always amalgamated learning and fun, it had
              been a momentous moment working so closely with this organization.

              Thinking out of the box and creating products was always inbuilt
              in me. This spark of curiosity got me on the path of being an
              engineering student. However it didn't turn out as I expected but
              riidl was the place where I rediscovered my passion again and was
              able to do what I love and do best. I decided to take consecutive
              year drops from academics to start my own company and build
              various technologies/products at riidl. riidl has an Amazing lab
              environment/ecosystem with great tools that helped me expand my
              imagination.

            <p>
              6 months program - Startup school India was a course that helped

              found this place which has become my home now.
